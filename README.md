# Starving Artists Roblox Art
This is a Node.js script that automatically draws things in the Roblox game starving artists. It reads an image from a specified folder, pixelates them, and then does movements in order to make the image.

# Usage

Install the following NPMs: 

fs, jimp, and robotjs

Place the image you want in to the images folder.

Tab into the game with your drawing menu open and it will begin

# Example
An example is attached as an image file, run the index.js file to see it.

# Notes
The ExampleGrid.png show which screen you should be on before running the script.

Modify the fastSpeed and SlowSpeed consts based on how fast your computer is.

It will only take the first image of the folder.
